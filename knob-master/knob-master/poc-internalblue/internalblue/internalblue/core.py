        opcode:     The LMP opcode of the LMP packet that will be injected.

        payload:    The LMP payload of the LMP packet that will be injected.
                    Note: The size of the payload is defined by its opcode.
                    TODO: Go one step deeper in order to send arbitrary length
                    LMP packets.

        extended_op:Set to True if the opcode should be interpreted as extended / escaped
                    LMP opcode.

        Returns True on success and False on failure.
